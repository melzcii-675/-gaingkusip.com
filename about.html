                             <p class="lead"><h4>3.4. Qembung established the first Mission Station at Boana in Naiasong</h4>
Now, God has heard the cry of Qembung and wiped away their tears, and opened the way for them to continue the gospel ministry into the remote areas. This time he did not took time for him to spread the gospel, he started the mission work in two places at the same time. He began in the northwest at Naiasong and also in the northeast at Rolinson.

<h5>3.4.1. Establishing the Naiasong Evangelist Station </h5>

In 1921, the son of Basang from Raningera, named Bekonuc, completed his teacher training at Heldsbach. Qembung chose him along with three other evangelists named; Timo, Baficnuc, and Muwecirec—to go and start mission work in Waing. Before that, they took six months of evangelist training at Qembung before send out to work in other places.
On August 5, 1922, the Christians from Qembung gathered and held a large worship service to send them off to the new mission area. They prayed over them, blessed them, and sent them on the first mission ship, named MV Bavaria, to Lae. On August 6, they arrived in Lae. Some Christians from Qembung also accompanied them, carrying their cargo and traveling with them. On August 10, 1922, they arrived at Naiasong.

Bekonuc later retired and stayed in his village. He wrote about this first missionary journey in the 1967 Niugini Lutheran publication at Logaweng:
"On August 10, we arrived at Naiasong and declared this place as our first mission station for Qembung."
Later, the people who had brought them left and returned to Qembung. The four evangelists remained in Naiasong and began building their houses. The people of Naiasong did not oppose them. Sometimes, they helped with the house construction, but other times, they did not assist, leaving the evangelists to do the work themselves. Eventually, they gathered the people, and the locals started hearing the Good News. Their missionary remained in Qembung, while the evangelists and teachers themselves took the lead in establishing evangelist stations.
</p>
                                    <p class="lead"><h5>3.4.2. Gaing became the Evangelist and Teacher Centre in the Northwest.</h5>
For three years, the evangelists have been in Naiasong as they found their work turn out to be true and satisfied. In 1925, the first group of evangelists and teachers in Naiasong left the evangelist Muwecirec who was still in Naiasong, and others started establishing evangelist stations in Gaing.

At this time, the Gaing people had already seen the White Skin (Foreigners) of the company and address them as Mihi Tuwa. The meaning of this declaration is as follows: Buy young men. Because they usually buy young men to take them to work on plantations and to work in gold mine. The Kiap also traveled with some native men from the area and observed them. The first group from Gain had gone to Rabaul including Gimbuhi, Kube, and some others.

When these evangelists first arrived in Gaing, they followed the mountains and did not walk in fears or silence, they walked and shouted just to get the attention of the villagers. And when the people in their bush houses heard these shouts from the evangelists, they said; some foreigners are coming. The Evangelists walked straight to Yoboing and saw that there were no people out there. All went and hid. After several days, they saw that only children were coming. But they stood far away and looked at them and they went away with fears. Now the evangelists made a gesture with their hands saying; we are hungry. The children saw this gesture from the evangelists and went to inform their parents by saying; the foreigners have arrived here for the past days and they are hungry. So they gave the food to the kids and the kids then provided for the evangelists. After that the elders slowly came and greeted the evangelists.

The first group of evangelists who came to Gaing were: Ev; Baficnuc; Hariepe, and a teacher whose name is Jasape. They started gathering people and get themselves known to many and lived in Yoboing for two years.  Yoboing is a small place on a mountain tops. The places is cold often, winters some times. Due to that reason, they migrated to Gaing in 1927. After getting more work at Gaing, it became a centre for missionary work in the northwest region. Many evangelists and teachers stayed in Gaing and worked a while and then they went again to some evangelist stations and their work improved very well while their ministry of gospel started to produce seeds. Because Gaing is situated between two languages, Numangong takes a part of Waing starting from Gaing up to Kwepmunung and then to the west it goes down to Kasangan in Erap. The evangelists and teachers have already settled in Gaing and afterwards they went to another area to extend the gospel; 
Ev. Hariepe is well-versed in the Numangong language and afterwards he went to Kasangan in Erap to help Manasingkec and Mareko. Ev. Baficnuc is also well-versed in the Numangong language therefore he was send by Bergmann to Kwepunung to teach the word of God in their language. Because the evangelists had previously gone to Kwepunung and delivered the gospel in Kâte language, but their hearts is so scattered. So Bergmann said; they heard the gospel in their language so they changed their hearts. Bergmann's statement came true. When Baficnuc left Gaing and went to Kwepunung to preach the gospel in the Numangong language, they changed their hearts. 
Ev. Bekanuc stayed a long time in Kasanombe and other missionsries such as: Ev. Kisu, Ev. Nombele, and teacher Zamenu.

Ev; Muwecirec became a father of missionary work in Naiasong. Muwecirec had been a long time in Naiasong until he became old and went back to his birthplace in Siucko and later he died.

<h5>3.4.3. The Qembung Patrol Team Arrives in Gaing.</h5>

The first patrol from Qembung with missionary Schnabel visited and observed all the work and the evangelists in 1929. They walked to Gaing. And the evangelists and the people had prepared a gate to welcome them with Tumbuna Singsing.
When the patrol team stood by the gate, the Gaing people told them. "If you promise us to send us a missionary, then we will open the gate for you to enter our village." The patrol team thought they were just creating a drama and they would quickly open the gate to allow them in. But no. They waited for a response and the gate still remained closed, almost too dark. So their leader Erao from Hapohondong promised to them; "When we return back home, we will send a missionary upon your request." When they heard the response fulfil their request, they shouted for joy and opened the gate, welcome them with Singsing has they enter the village. After that, they brought a report to Qembung and they talked about sending a missionary to Boana. This event occurred in Gaing and two children witnessed it, they both narrated. Wongege was a kid in age of seven to ten and witness all this things happened in Gaing and Ronuc son of Erao was aged behind Wongege, he often cried just to be with his father everywhere he goes. Therefore he followed his father in the patrol all over Boana and when they arrived in Gaing, he saw this event occurred, and so he narrated. In 1932 they sent missionary Gustav Bergmann or Tikiῃic and his wife Anna all the way to Boana and establish the Boana missionary station as it is the first missionary of Boana.
